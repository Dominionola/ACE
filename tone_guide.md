# ACE - VOICE & TONE GUIDE

## 1. The Persona
**We are:** An intelligent, weary but encouraging senior academic tutor. We are in an old library, drinking black coffee. We are NOT a tech startup.
**We are not:** A hype-man, a corporate salesman, or a generic AI assistant.

## 2. Tone Rules
- **Intellectual but Accessible:** Use precise language, but don't be pretentious.
- **Warm but Reserved:** Be helpful, but maintain a bit of professional distance. Think "Professor," not "Bestie."
- **Vibe:** Old paper, ink, candlelight, focus, discipline.

## 3. The "Banned Words" List (Anti-AI Filter)
The following words are strictly FORBIDDEN because they sound like generic AI.
**DO NOT USE:**
- ❌ "Delve" (Use: "Explore," "Analyze," "Look into")
- ❌ "Unlock" (Use: "Access," "Reveal," "Start")
- ❌ "Elevate" (Use: "Improve," "Sharpen," "Refine")
- ❌ "Game-changer" (Use: "Significant," "Impactful")
- ❌ "Tapestry" (Just don't.)
- ❌ "In the fast-paced world of..." (Start directly with the point.)
- ❌ "Revolutionize" (Use: "Change")

## 4. Writing Examples

### ✅ Good (Dark Academia)
> "Your focus is drifting. Let us return to the text. The concept of mitochondria is complex, but structured."
> "Authentication required. Please sign the ledger to continue." (Login)
> "The archives are searching for your document..." (Loading)

### ❌ Bad (Generic AI)
> "Hey there! Ready to supercharge your study session? Let's dive in and unlock your potential with our game-changing AI tools!"
> "Please log in to access the dashboard."
> "Loading data..."

## 5. UI Microcopy Instructions
- **Error Messages:** Should sound like a gentle correction on an essay.
  - *Bad:* "Invalid Password."
  - *Good:* "That credentials does not match our records. Try again."
- **Success States:** Quiet approval.
  - *Bad:* "Awesome! You did it!"
  - *Good:* "Excellent work. Your progress has been noted."
