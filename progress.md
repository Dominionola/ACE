# ACE - AI Study Companion: Project Progress & Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Goal
To build an intelligent, distraction-free study companion that helps students master their materials through active recall.
**Value Proposition:** "Turn any document into a personalized tutor."
**Core Loop:** Upload Materials -> AI Analysis -> Active Study (Quiz/Chat) -> Progress Tracking.

## 🛠 Methodology
We follow an **Agentic Development** approach, prioritizing:
1.  **Iterative Implementation:** Building feature-by-feature (Auth -> Decks -> RAG -> Quizzes -> Grades).
2.  **Server-First Architecture:** Utilizing Next.js Server Actions and Supabase to keep client logic thin and secure.
3.  **Strict Type Safety:** Zod validation at every entry point (Server Actions, Forms).
4.  **AI-Native Design:** Embedding Generative AI (Gemini) deeply into the study workflow, not just as a chatbot.
